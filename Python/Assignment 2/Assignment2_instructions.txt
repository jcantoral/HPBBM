Exercise 2. Lets improve the script you submitted for the Unit 1 assignment using the tools learned in Unit2 (flow
control): Write a program that ask the user for a DNA sequence (keyboard input) and do the following:

  1. If the provided sequence is RNA, warn the user, but translate it to DNA and continue.
  2. If the sequence provided by the user is not DNA or RNA (protein or other...) inform the user that it only
accepts DNA sequences and stop the program.
  3. Report detailed sequence statistics: sequence length, % of each base and % of each dinucleotide
  4. Check if there are restriction sites for any of the following restriction enzymes: EcoRI (GAATTC), BamHI
(GGATCC), HindIII (AAGCTT) and NotI (GCGGCCGC).
  5. If any of these enzymes cut the DNA report ALL the sites where it cuts.
