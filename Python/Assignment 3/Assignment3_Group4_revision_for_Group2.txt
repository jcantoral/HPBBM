# My Group number: Group 4
# My Group members: Jesus Cantoral, Alberto Ferrera and Leticia Rodriguez
# Group evaluated: Group 2

# Commented code (Grade): 2
# Commented code (justification of your grade): Somewhat a bit undercommented, yet correct. Basic Python knowledge or a quick lookup in the documentation would be enough to understand the code.

# Code Logic (Grade): 2
# Code Logic (justification of your grade): We find the code to be neat and very well structured.

# Variable names, code indentation,... (Grade): 2
# Variable names, code indentation,... (justification of your grade): Names are informative and intuitive to the programmer.

# Does the script work? (Grade): 2
# Does the script work? (justification of your grade): The script runs fast. The output file and sequences are correct. It is not required, but maybe using a FASTA format (sequences include a first >Title line). A nice print() message informs the user via the Python interpreter the script has ended. Perhaps informing the actual name of the file could be useful (anyway, a new file appears). Overall, we would like to congratulate Group 2 for their work.
