# Variable names, code indentation,...:
	Issues:
	1. Line 5: The method 'replace' is correct but not necessary here. 
	2. Lines 16-19 and 24-25: Use of function 'print' properties not seen in class (printing the value of variables inside a print string)
	3. The program doesn't show the possible restriction enzymes to the user. This is the most important reason to the grade.
	4. Last line: This is not explained to the user (but it is to the programmer).
	
In general, we think the script is well written and explained for the programmer, but not for the user.
