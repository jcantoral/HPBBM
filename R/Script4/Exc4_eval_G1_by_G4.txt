>Files are correctly read +4
>Lengths of seqs OK +4
>Frequencies of Ts OK +4
>Summaries OK +4
>Org, logic and results +4


###Minor comments:

>Perhaps using the "stringr" package is not that convenient.
It requires its intallation. Grep is present in R out-of-the-box.
Yes, using grep for this not optimal, but it would do the job without
any aditional packages. Anyway, "stringr" works too and it's correct.

>grepl is okay, but perhaps not necessary. After all, why not obtain
the character vector directly, and not a logical vector?

>Good use of user-defined functions. Congrats on the use of vapply.
>Nice use of "message" to help the user. Not required, but handy.
>Could the prints in the last part be avoided?
>The code is clean and straightforward, well structured and atomic
thanks to those functions. Perhaps including another user-defined function
to print the summary could have been appropriate too. Once again, not necessary.

Functions output seems correct. Nevertheless, we would like to suggest that,
in the rubrica, the expected output is included so we can truly evaluate
whether the output is correct.
(We believe the output is correct because it matches ours, though psychic powers
could be included for following years in this course).
