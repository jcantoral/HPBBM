## R Assignment 4 
##Group 4 revision to Group 2
#Jesus Cantoral, Alberto Ferrera, Leticia Rodriguez

##Section 1. Tables and crosstabs. +3

Nice use of length.out = ncol(leuk.dat.m).

##Section 2. Two subsetting operations. +2

We hadn't thought of "[sex == 'Male']",
it seems better than using "which(...)".

##Section 3.

#3.1. +1
#3.2.+2
#3.3. +2
#3.4. +2
#3.5. +3

We believe the assignment was easy and straightforward,
there's not much to say. Group 2 has done the job:
the code runs well and gets what is requested. Congrats.

Overall grade: 3+2+1+2+2+2+3 = 15.
